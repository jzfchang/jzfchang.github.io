				<h2>Summary</h2>
               <p>Given a site in South Boston at the intersection of A and Summer Street, we 
were to design a public space and art gallery building. Beginning from the 
two street entraces and elevation differences, I centered the theme of my 
building on the circulation as an experience.
    <p>
Beginning at the lower A Street entrance, the building’s staircase is open 
as public space and the temporary art gallery’s large glass walls allow it to 
be viewed while ascending to the Summer Street level. This was to engage 
the public as it would be possible to see the changes in the gallery display 
even if the visitor was only using the staircase to go between the two street 
levels. One of the themes was the integration of circulation into program 
and rooms. In the performance hall, the public stairs to ascend further into 
the building or into the hall run along the same rake as the theater steps, 
blending the two spaces and keeping the hall an open experience. </p>
<p>
The cafe similarly becomes an interesting space carved out by circulation, 
with the stairs wrapping around and giving two distinct levels of occupation. At the very top of Promenade is the public terrace intermingled with a 
permanant art gallery. The piece displayed was to be Do Ho Suh’s Staircase 
V, a replica of his New York apartment stair in translucent red fabric, hanging from the ceiling</p>
